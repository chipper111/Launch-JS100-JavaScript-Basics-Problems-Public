Array Element Access

Locate the documentation for the Array built-in object on MDN.

How can we access the element 'and' in the array ['fish', 'and', 'chips']?

*/

/* My Solution

Since arrays have a zero based index, we could access "and" by using bracket notation as in arr[1]. You could also have the 1 in quotes such as arr['1']. This will yield the same results since JavaScript coerces the 1 into a string anyway using the toString( ) method.
