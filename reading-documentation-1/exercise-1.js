Finding Documentation

What is an excellent destination when looking for JavaScript documentation?


*/

/* My Solution => 

My favorite destination for documentation is MDN Web Docs. I've subscribed to MDN Plus to support this great resource as well. The documents have an offline mode which makes lookup extremely fast. Also, I find it's better to use the same good resource consistently. It makes you more efficient at navigating docs since you get accustomed to the layout.
