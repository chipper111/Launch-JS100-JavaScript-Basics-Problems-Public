Out of Bounds

What happens if we take the array ['fish', 'and', 'chips'] and try to access the element at index position 10? Try this in your JavaScript console.

*/

let arr = ["fish", "and", "chips"];
console.log(arr[10]);
// undefined
// Answer: The output would be undefined. JavaScript doesn't have an Out of Bounds Error.
