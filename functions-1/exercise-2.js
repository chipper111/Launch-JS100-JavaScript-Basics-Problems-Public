Exercise 2

Write a function that logs Brendan Eich's quote 'Always bet on JavaScript.' to the console. What is the return value of the function?
*/

function brendanEichQuote() {
  console.log("Always bet on JavaScript.");
}

brendanEichQuote();
// logs:
// Always bet on JavaScript.
// As all functions would do, it implicitly returns undefined since we didn't explicitly add a return statement.
